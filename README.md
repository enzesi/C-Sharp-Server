# C-Sharp-Server

This is a C# server with angular front-end, angular front-end code is in another repository.

I used visual studio community 2017 for Mac to do all the coding.Other IDE may not be able to run the server.

Firstly, open simplehttpserver.sln under simplehttpserver folder in visual studio community 2017 for Mac, build and run it. A terminal will pop up.

Then open http://localhost:8080 in a web browser to see the project.
